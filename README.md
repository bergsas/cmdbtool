Cmdbtool
========

Background
----------
''libcmdb'' is a library for a configuration management database (CMDB)
made by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. I dunno if it's publicly
available. I, however, like using github. :)

Important
---------

Remember:

  Do not commit unless current ''version''
  works.
